ðŸŒ± 1. Inventory Monitoring
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: To track all seedling stocks automatically without manual checking.

Old way: The owner checks stocks manually by counting or reviewing notebooks/Excel sheets.

New way: System shows real-time stock levels (how many seedlings available, sold, or low).

ðŸŒ± 2. Automated Report Generation
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: To generate automatic reports based on all inventory activities (added stock, deducted stock, sales, damages).

Old way: Reports are made manually, consuming a lot of time and prone to errors.

New way: Reports (daily, weekly, monthly) are automatically created by the system in PDF/Excel.

ðŸŒ± 3. Damage Reports
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: To record and track damaged seedlings, which was not possible before.

Old way: Damages were not formally recorded, leading to lost seedlings without proper accountability.

ðŸŒ± 4. Sales Recording / Online Customer Orders
ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: To allow recording of walk-in sales and optionally accept online customer orders.

Old way: Sales are handwritten in notebooks or typed manually in Excel.

New way: Sales are logged digitally in the system; customers can also place online orders that automatically update inventory.
