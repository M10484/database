ðŸŒ± 1. Automated Inventory Tracking

ðŸ‘‰ Means the system will automatically update the stock count every time new plants or seedlings are added (stock-in) or sold (stock-out).

Example sa nursery: Kung may 100 orchids at may customer na bumili ng 5, the system will auto-update at magiging 95 na lang ang stock.

ðŸŒ± 2. Sales Recording / POS Module

ðŸ‘‰ A digital way of recording all sales transactions, just like a mini point-of-sale (POS).

Example sa nursery: Kapag may customer na bumili ng 10 succulents, ilalagay ng cashier sa system, and it will automatically compute the total price and even print a receipt if needed.

ðŸŒ± 3. Automated Report Generation

ðŸ‘‰ The system can create sales and inventory reports instantly, without manual computation.

Example sa nursery: At the end of the week, the owner can generate a report showing which plants sold the most, total revenue, and remaining stocks.

ðŸŒ± 4. Low-stock Alerts & Reorder Suggestions

ðŸ‘‰ The system gives notifications if certain plants or seedlings are running low on stock and can suggest when to reorder.

Example sa nursery: Kung 5 na lang ang natitirang rose plants (out of 50), the system will alert the owner/staff and suggest reordering from the supplier before stock runs out.

ðŸŒ± 5. Customer Management & Transaction History

ðŸ‘‰ The system stores customer details and their purchase history for future reference.

Example sa nursery: If a customer frequently buys fertilizers or a certain type of bonsai, the owner can offer promos, discounts, or notify them when new stocks arrive.
